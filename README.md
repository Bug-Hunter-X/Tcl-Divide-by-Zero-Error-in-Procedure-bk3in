This repository demonstrates a common error in Tcl: the unhandled divide-by-zero error. The `bug.tcl` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.tcl` provides a corrected version.  The error occurs when the procedure `buggyProc` is called with 0 as the first argument, resulting in a runtime error. The solution introduces robust error handling to prevent this.
